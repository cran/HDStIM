Description: A method for identifying responses to experimental stimulation in mass or flow cytometry that uses high dimensional analysis of measured parameters and can be performed with an end-to-end unsupervised approach. In the context of in vitro stimulation assays where high-parameter cytometry was used to monitor intracellular response markers, using cell populations annotated either through automated clustering or manual gating for a combined set of stimulated and unstimulated samples, 'HDStIM' labels cells as responding or non-responding. The package also provides auxiliary functions to rank intracellular markers based on their contribution to identifying responses and generating diagnostic plots.
